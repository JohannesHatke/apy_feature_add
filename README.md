# apy

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/index.html) is a flash card program which makes
remembering things easy. `apy` is a Python script for easily adding cards to
Anki.

### Important

* This is currently **WORK IN PROGRESS**, and there may still be some major
  changes.
* The current version should be compatible with Anki 2.1.26 (see the
  [changelog](#changelog) to find versions compatible with older versions of
  Anki).
* This script and its author(s) are not affiliated/associated with the main
  Anki project in any way.
* Use this software entirely at your own risk. Frequent backups are encouraged.

## Install instructions

To install `apy`, you can do something like this:

```bash
# Install latest version
pip install --user git+https://github.com/lervag/apy.git#egg=apy

# One can also do
git clone https://github.com/lervag/apy.git
pip install -e .
```

**Important**: `apy` uses the python API from the Anki desktop app. So please
  make sure to install the Anki source. Note that the releases on
  [Ankiweb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download) only include precompiled
  binaries. Ankiweb recommends that one uses these precompiled binaries, but
  for `apy` to work one needs the Anki source to be available. These are
  typically included if one installs from repositories (e.g. with `sudo apt
  install anki` or `pacman -S anki`). One may also download the source either
  from the ["Development" tab on Ankiweb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#dev) or
  from [github](https://github.com/dae/anki).

`apy` assumes that the Anki source is available at `/usr/share/anki`. If you
put it somewhere else, then you must set the environment variable
`APY_ANKI_PATH`, e.g. `export APY_ANKI_PATH=/my/path/to/anki`.

## Usage

```sh
apy --help
```

Some examples:

```sh
# Add card with interactive editor session
apy add

# Add single card with specified preset (see configuration for more info on
# presets)
apy add-single -p preset "Question/Front" "Answer/Back"

# List leech cards (will show cid values for each card). Note that the query
# should be similar to a search query in the Anki browser.
apy list -v tag:leech

# Review and possibly edit file with given cid
apy review cid:12345678
```

`apy` can be combined with editor specific configuration and workflows to
improve the process of adding and editing cards. For more information about
this, see [the Wiki](https://github.com/lervag/apy/wiki/Vim).

## Configuration

`apy` loads configuration from `~/.config/apy/apy.json`. The following keys are
currently recognized:

- `base`: Specify where `apy` should look for your Anki database. This is
  usually something like `/home/your_name/.local/share/Anki2/`.
- `img_viewers`: Specify a dictionary of image viewer commands. Each key is
  a file extension. The value is a command list, e.g. `['display', 'density',
  '300']` which specifies the command and its options to use for the
  corresponding key (file extension).
- `img_viewers_default`: Specify the default command to show an image. Must be
  provided as a list of the command and desired options, such as `['feh',
  '-d']`.
- `markdown_models`: Specify a list of models for which `apy` will use
  a markdown converter.
- `pngCommands`/`svgCommands`: Set LaTeX commands to generate PNG/SVG files.
  This is inspired by the [Edit LaTeX build
  process](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/937148547) addon to Anki.
- `presets`: Specify preset combination of model and tags for use with `apy
  add-single`.
- `profile`: Specify which profile to load by default.
- `query`: Specify default query for `apy list`, `apy review` and `apy tag`.

An example configuration:

```json
{
  "base": "/home/your_name/.local/share/Anki2/",
  "profile": "MyAnkiProfile",
  "query": "tag:leech",
  "presets": {
    "default": { "model": "Custom", "tags": ["marked"] }
  },
  "pngCommands": [
    ["latex", "-interaction=nonstopmode", "tmp.tex"],
    ["dvipng", "-D", "150", "-T", "tight", "-bg", "Transparent",
      "tmp.dvi", "-o", "tmp.png"]
  ],
  "svgCommands": [
    ["lualatex", "-interaction=nonstopmode", "tmp.tex"],
    ["pdfcrop", "tmp.pdf", "tmp.pdf"],
    ["pdf2svg", "tmp.pdf", "tmp.svg"]
  ]
}
```

## Zsh completion

There is also a zsh completion file available. To use it, one may symlink or
copy it to a location that is already in ones `fpath` variable, or one may add
the `apy/completion` directory to the `fpath` list.

As an example, one may first symlink the `_apy` file:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/zsh-functions
ln -s /path/to/apy/completion/_apy ~/.local/zsh-functions
```

Then add the following line to ones `.zshrc` file:

```sh
fpath=($HOME/.local/zsh-functions $fpath)
```

## Changelog

This is just a simple changelog. See the commit history and issue threads for
details. The main purpose of the changelog is to show which versions of apy are
compatible with which versions of Anki.

## Relevant resources

Here are a list of relevant resources for learning how to work with the Anki
databases and code:
* [AnkiDroid: Database
  Structure](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Database-Structure)
* [AnkiConnect.py](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect/blob/master/AnkiConnect.py)
* [The Anki Manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html)

## Alternatives

Here are some alternatives to `apy` from which I've drawn inspiration. I've
also added a short note on why I did not just settle for the alternative.

### Ankiconnect

[Ankiconnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/) is an Anki plugin [2055492159](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)) hosted on [github](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect).

> Ankiconnect enables external applications to communicate with Anki over
> a network interface. The exposed API makes it possible to execute queries
> against the userâ€™s card deck, automatically create new vocabulary and Kanji
> flash cards, and more.

A couple of relevant applications that use Ankiconnect:

* [Anki Quick Adder](https://codehealthy.com/chrome-anki-quick-adder/):
  A Chrome extension to add words to Anki desktop quickly.

* [Anki-editor](https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor) is an emacs plugin for
  making Anki cards with Org.

* [anki-cli](https://github.com/towercity/anki-cli) is a simple nodejs based
  command-line interface for Anki.

_The Dealbreaker_: I wanted a script that does not require Anki to be running.

### Anki::Import - Anki note generation made easy

[Anki::Import](https://github.com/sdondley/Anki-Import) (see also
[here](https://metacpan.org/pod/Anki::Import)) allows one to "Efficiently
generate Anki notes with your text editor for easy import into Anki". Quote:

> Inputting notes into Anki can be a tedious chore. Anki::Import lets you you
> generate Anki notes with your favorite text editor (e.g. vim, BBEdit, Atom,
> etc.) so you can enter formatted notes into Anki's database more
> efficiently.

_The Dealbreaker_: This sounds very good, except there are too many steps.
I didn't want to have to open Anki desktop. It should work flawlessly directly
from the terminal.

### AnkiVim

[AnkiVim](https://github.com/MFreidank/AnkiVim) may be used to "Use vim to
rapidly write textfiles immediately importable into anki(1)."

_The Dealbreaker_: Similar to `Anki::Import`: I didn't want to have to open
Anki desktop. It should work flawlessly directly from the terminal.

### Knowledge (Vim plugin)

[Knowledge](https://github.com/tbabej/knowledge) is a Vim plugin for generating
flash cards to either Anki or Mnemosyne.

_The Dealbreaker_: It has [a single, open
issue](https://github.com/tbabej/knowledge/issues/1), which seems to indicate
that the application does not work very well and/or is not well maintained.

### Ankisync

[Ankisync](https://github.com/patarapolw/ankisync) seems somewhat promising, in
that it exposes an API for working with Anki collections from Python. It is
a successor to [AnkiTools](https://github.com/patarapolw/AnkiTools), which is
stated to be "an Anki *.apkg and collection.anki2 reader and editor".

_The Dealbreaker_: It does not include any features to add or edit notes (as
far as I could tell).

### Genanki

[Genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) is a library for generating
Anki decks.

_The Dealbreaker_: It is quite close to being something I wanted, except that
it needs to run as a plugin to Anki desktop to generate notes to a local
collection. It does not seem to allow editing/adding to a local collection
outside of Anki desktop.
